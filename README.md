# Contribute to Musicophilia

Are You a newbie in the world of open source and want to Contribute to our Open Source Project ?
Don't worry we got your back.

Below are the steps to follow to contribute to this project 

1. #### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

2. ## Fork this repository
<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

3. ## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/Musicophilia.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

4. ## Navigate to the project directory :file_folder: .

```
cd Musicophilia
```
5. ## Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nilisha-jais/Musicophilia.git 
```
6. ## Check the remotes for this repository.

```
git remote -v
```
7. ## Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project(updated repository) this will avoid the merge conflicts.

```
git pull upstream master
```
8. ## Create a branch
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-issueno.x
```
(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your solved issue to the project.)

9. ## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Perform your desired changes to the code base.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add <file name>
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add new feature <issue-no> to the main repo "
```

replacing `<issue-no>` with the issue number you are assigned.

10. ## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

11. ## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
